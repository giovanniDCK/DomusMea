# DomusMea
Domotic Baseline for Arduino Activites


Components Needed
Arduino UNO MINI
MKR GSM 1400
DHT11 or DHT22 sensor (for temperature and humidity)
Relay modules (for controlling lights)
Light sensors (optional, for automated light control)
Motion sensors (PIR) (optional, for security and automated lighting)
Push buttons or switches (for manual control)
LEDs or actual home lighting systems
SIM card with GSM service for the MKR GSM 1400
Breadboard and jumper wires
Basic Features
Light Control: Control home lights using relays.
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Use DHT sensors to monitor and display temperature and humidity.
GSM Alerts: Send SMS alerts for specific events (e.g., high temperature).
Wiring Diagram
DHT Sensor: Connect the data pin to a digital pin on the UNO MINI, VCC to 5V, and GND to GND.
Relay Module: Connect the control pin to a digital pin on the UNO MINI, VCC to 5V, and GND to GND.
GSM Module: Connect the MKR GSM 1400 via serial communication to the UNO MINI.
Push Buttons: Connect one end to a digital pin on the UNO MINI and the other end to GND.
